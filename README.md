<i><b>Okay</b></i>, that's a little too much 😅.<br>
We will just try to click fast as possible in the <strong>green button</strong> on the screen.<br>

It consists in three files, the <a href="https://github.com/mateusfilipe/Get-The-Button/blob/master/index.html">index.html</a> which is the main, the <a href="https://github.com/mateusfilipe/Get-The-Button/blob/master/btnStyle.css">btnStyle.css</a> with<br>
the css style and the <a href="https://github.com/mateusfilipe/Get-The-Button/blob/master/btnFunctions.js">btnFunctions.js</a> to control the js functions.

 <li>Day 1 ✔️<br>
 First day working, my first impression is: that sounded simpler im my head. But i did the skeleton of  the project
 built a green button that goes to a random place on the screen, one button to start and one to return the button.
 Also i created a simple score that cout the times you clicked the green button. Looking forward for where it can go.</li>
 <li>Day 2 ✔️<br>
 Second day on the project, not going so well. I can't find a way to make to button keeps constantly moving on the screen.
 So today I just changed some functions and tried new things.
 </li>
 <li>Day 3 ✔️<br>
 BEST DAY (so far), had a mind block for a few days I wasn't feeling very conffident about the project or what I'm able to do.
 After talking with my friend and discussing some ideas, he cheered me up to search for other ways to work, so here it is. Now the button
 with a interval in the page it goes to random places on the screen after you click on the start button (it won't stop, but we will see that later),
 and now we have difficult option, so it's basically done. Just need to finish the style.
 </li>
 <li>Day 4 ✔️<br>
 Done, everything is working (i think). The style is simple but, I will probably change some things in the future. 
 If you have any idea feel free to contact me.
