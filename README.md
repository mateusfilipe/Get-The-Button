<i><b>Okay</b></i>, that's a little too much 😅.<br>
We will just try to click fast as possible in the <strong>green button</strong> on the screen.<br>

It consists in three files, the <a href="https://github.com/mateusfilipe/Get-The-Button/blob/master/index.html">index.html</a> which is the main, the <a href="https://github.com/mateusfilipe/Get-The-Button/blob/master/btnStyle.css">btnStyle.css</a> with<br>
the css style and the <a href="https://github.com/mateusfilipe/Get-The-Button/blob/master/btnFunctions.js">btnFunctions.js</a> to control the js functions.

 <li>Day 1 ✔️<br>
 First day working, my first impression is: that sounded simpler im my head. But i did the skeleton of  the project
 built a green button that goes to a random place on the screen, one button to start and one to return the button.
 Also i created a simple score that cout the times you clicked the green button. Looking forward for where it can go.</li>
 <li>Day 2 ✔️<br>
 Second day on the project, not going so well. I can't find a way to make to button keeps constantly moving on the screen.
 So today I just changed some functions and tried new things.
